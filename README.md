Embedded computing is a sector in strong growth, driven by the increasing offer in the internet of things. Since position information is 
typically one of the intrinsic features of a sensory platform, the present work considers and analyzes the embedded lossless compression 
of localization data. A structural data scheme is proposed based on the number of occurrences of the independent coordinate components, 
named as ÂµJSON. It is shown that, when considering a low-level language implementation on an embedded processor acquiring GNSS data, the 
proposed schema implies lower compression rates than its counterparts. An embedded test-bench platform is assembled, and several real case 
scenarios are considered for effectiveness and validation purposes.
